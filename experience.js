/**
 * THIS SHOULD CONTAIN ALL WHAT WE UNDERSTAND OR HAVE UNDERSTOOD DURING THESE SEASSON
 * AS SUCH YOU CAN CONTINUE
 * 
 * Today we are to build a calculator which will be the theme of our coding seasson today
 * This will comprise of all what we have done
 * In order to do this, we have to create a document on google docs which contains all details
 * on how we started.
 * If you are working in another persons project, you will not always have access to the main 
 * branch(to avoid merge conflicts).Hence you can create a local/dev |feature branch
 * by default you will have powershell which you will use as your terminal but you have to change t
 * bash by just clicking on the + signe below and change the terminal to bash
 * In the terminal, to create your own branch, you can do as the example below
 * example: git branch tata-ngwa(In your terminal and press enter) you have just created a local branch;
 * this example will just create the branch but will not be active that is
 * you wont be able to work inside the branch . To be active in your branch, do this:
 * //git checkout tata-ngwa. this will take you directly to your local branch and you will be 
 * working on it until you decide to change.
 * in order words to create a branch and enter directly use this command
 * //git checkout -b <branchname>(with this, even if the branchname exist, there is still no problem)
 * to delete a branch, use this
 * //git checkout -D <branchname>
 * To know your active branch
 * //git branch
 *  To know all the branches
 * //git branch --all
 * you can add and commit at once by using the command 
 * git add . && git commit -m "commit"
 * If you have two local branches (billy) & (chantal)and you have worked in chantal but the branch you want 
 * to push online is billy, you first do a git check out billy to access billy then you do 
 * git merge chantal in billy (all what you worked on in chantal will be copied to billy).
 * you then pull && push online.
 * git checkout(takes you from one branch to another).
 * before you push, you have to merge directly online
 * Delete this and continue....
